# DWA_07.4 Challenge 1

## Project Description

In this challenge, you will revisit the previous abstractions you created in the [“Book Connect”](https://github.com/katlegomaphango/DWA-6) project and consider them through the lens of SOLID.

Take a moment to rate all your abstractions in terms of the best three and the worst three. Attempt to apply SOLID principles to the worst three as means to improve them.

You will have a call with your coach where you highlight the following:

- Which were the three best abstractions, and why?
- Which were the three worst abstractions, and why?
- How can the three worst abstractions be improved via SOLID principles?

## Getting Started: 
1. Clone repo
```
git clone https://github.com/katlegomaphango/DWA-7.git
```
2. Run localhost server
3. Open index.html
