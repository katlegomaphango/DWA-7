# DWA_07.4 Challenge 1

## Description

In this challenge, you will revisit the previous abstractions you created in the [“Book Connect”](https://github.com/katlegomaphango/DWA-6) project and consider them through the lens of SOLID Principles.
Take a moment to rate all your abstractions in terms of the best three and the worst three. Attempt to apply SOLID principles to the worst three as means to improve them.

### you highlight the following:

- Which were the three best abstractions, and why?
- Which were the three worst abstractions, and why?
- How can the three worst abstractions be improved via SOLID principles?
