# DWA_06.5 Challenge 1

## Project Description

This exercise presents you with a working version of the [“Book Connect”](https://github.com/CodeSpace-Academy/book-connect) website you previously audited as your [final challenge](https://github.com/katlegomaphango/KATMAP076_FTO2301_GroupB_KatlegoMaphango_ITW19). However, you must use objects and functions as abstractions to make the code more maintainable, extendable and easier to change.
Also, please remember that you are encouraged to consider higher-level concepts discussed in the previous lessons, such as documentation, Styleguides and abstractions.
As always, it is essential to note that you will be required to talk about the “how” and “why” you made specific decisions and not just present the “what” of the decisions that you made.

## Getting Started: 
1. Clone repo
```
git clone https://github.com/katlegomaphango/DWA-6.git
```
2. Run localhost server
3. Open index.html
